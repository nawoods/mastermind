# Mastermind

Command-line implementation of the board game 
[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) in Ruby. Exercise for
[the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop?ref=lnav).

Note: the feedback provided by my implementation of the game is unordered; that is, a red response peg signifies that one of the guess pegs is the correct color and in the correct location, but does not specify which peg is the correct one. A white response peg signifies that one of the guess pegs is the correct color but not in the right location.

See the [ruby-projects](https://github.com/nawoods/ruby-projects) repository for more Odin Project Ruby course solutions.
